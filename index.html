    <h4>Carrot is an esoteric programming language made for code-golf created by <a href="http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/">Programming Puzzles and Code Golf(PPCG)</a> user <a href="http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/41805/">Kritixi Lithos</a>.</h4>
    <h4>Credits: Carrot was inspired by TeaScript, CJam, Pyth, V and Retina. This <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto+Mono">Roboto Mono</a> font is from Google Fonts. </h4>
    <h2>Quick Intro:</h2>
    <p>
      This is how every program in Carrot looks like:
      <br>
    </p>
    <div class="code"><i>stack</i>^<i>operations</i></div>

    <p>The <i>stack</i> starts off as a String that can further be manipulated with the <i>operations</i>. The <i>stack</i> doesn't need to be enclosed in quotes. Another thing to note is the the <i>stack</i> is basically a String and <b>not</b> an array.
      Next up is the caret "^". This is required in every program as it seperates the <i>stack</i> from the <i>operations</i>. The <i>operations</i> manipulate the <i>stack</i>, to put it simply. At the termination of the program, the <i>stack</i>, after
      all the <i>operations</i> are applied, is printed to the output.</p>

    <!--p>
        <div class="code">Hello, World!^</div>
        This is a simple "Hello, World!" program. "Hello, World!" is pushed into the stack and is printed to the console.
        
        A shorter version would be:
        <div class="code">Hello, World!</div>
    </p>
    <p>
        <div class="code">as^+"df"</div>
        This code prints "asdf" to the output. Here is how it works: first "as" is pushed onto the stack. Then it is concatenated (using the "+") with "df". Note how the stack doesn't require quotes but the commands do require them.
    </p>
    <p>
        <div class="code">asdfghjkl^-3</div>
        This code prints "asdfgh" to the output. Here is how it works: first "asdfghjkl" is pushed onto the stack. Then the "-" operator performs a substring to the string. Because the number after the "-" is 3, the length of the stack is reduced by 3 as such: "asdfghjkl" - "jkl" = "asdfgh".
    </p>
    
    <p>
    	<div class="code">as^*1</div>
    	The code prints "asas" to the output. Here is how it works: first "as" is pushed onto the stack. Then comes the "*" operator. It multiples the string by n+1 times where "n" is the number after the "*". Therefore, the stack "as" is multiplied by 1+1=2 times like so: "as"+"as"="asas".
    </p>
    <p>
        <div class="code">0123^/2</div>
        The code prints "013" to the console. The "/" removes character at index 2(the number after the "/" sign).
    </p>
